"""The request trace writer accounts for every record it is given.

A frozen copy of the trace is only as good as the claim that it holds what was
served. The writer therefore classifies each submitted record exactly once --
persisted (in its shard, newline-terminated, flushed and fsync()ed), dropped by
reason, unknown (bytes may have landed but the write or fsync holding them
failed), or still pending -- and publishes that accounting atomically beside the
shards, with each shard's durable byte range. These drive the real writer
through the failures that break that claim: a write that stops mid-record in the
middle of a UTF-8 character, a full disk, a failed fsync, a stalled filesystem
with a saturated queue, a writer that dies and a successor that appends to the
same file, and a sidecar write that fails. In every case the books must
balance, no record is counted as persisted on bytes that were not fsync()ed,
and a fragment never corrupts the record written after it.
