"""Unit tests for the raw model-output dump.

The dump exists to be read next to a request trace while debugging a parser, so
what these pin down is mostly what a reader of the two files together relies on:
that the frames arrive separated, that the id joining them is the one the client
saw, and above all that the hook changed nothing on its way past.
