"""The smallest thing `gateway.py` will route to: a fake fleet member.

This exists so the handover tests can run a REAL gateway on a laptop or a CI
box -- no SLURM, no GPUs, no model. It implements exactly the three things the
gateway asks of a backend and nothing else:

1. **Discovery.** The gateway reads `<fleet-dir>/*.json`; each file is one
   backend (`Fleet.read_registrations` / `Fleet.discover`). This process does
   not write that file itself -- the test harness does, because the registration
   is written by the serving job's *controller*, and the scenario that matters
   most for the supervisor (`revive_dead_backends`) is precisely "controller
   alive and writing heartbeats, server dead". Keeping the two apart is what
   lets the harness stage that.

2. **Health.** `probe()` opens a connection and does `GET /v1/models`, then
   looks for `" 200 "` in the status line. Nothing else counts -- deliberately,
   see the docstring on `gateway.probe`. `--mode-file` flips this answer at
   runtime between 200 (healthy) and 503 (present but not serving), which is
   how a test makes a backend sick without killing the process that heartbeats
   for it.

3. **Proxying.** Every other path is relayed verbatim by `Gateway.proxy`. The
   reply carries `X-Backend-Id`, which survives the relay untouched, so a
   client can tell which backend served it. `X-Test-Delay: <seconds>` makes a
   request stay in flight for a controlled length of time, which is how the
   drain window is exercised.

Run standalone:
