"""End-to-end tests for the gateway hot handover (CONTRACT.md, work item F).

The property these exist to protect is one sentence:

    During a handover, a client holding a steady stream of requests sees
    **zero refused connections and zero failed in-flight requests**.

Everything else here is secondary, and the file is arranged so that the
secondary things cannot dilute it: `test_handover_serves_every_request` asserts
that sentence and nothing else, against a real `gateway.py` process that spawns
a real successor, measured by a real client on raw sockets.

Why a process test and not a unit test. Every mechanism in the contract is a
property of two processes and a kernel: `SO_REUSEPORT` splitting a listen
queue, `flock` released by process death, a listener closing while its handlers
are still running, a successor surviving `start_new_session=True`. A mock of
`gateway.py` would have to model all four, and the modelling is where the bugs
would be.

Running them::

    pytest examples/serve/large_scale_serving/tests/test_gateway_handover.py -v

No SLURM, no GPU, no network beyond loopback. Roughly two and a half minutes.
Every wait is bounded; nothing here can hang. `pytest --timeout=600` is a
reasonable belt-and-braces if pytest-timeout happens to be installed, but the
tests do not require it.

Until work items A-E land these fail, on purpose, naming the missing clause.
