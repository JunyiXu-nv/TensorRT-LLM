"""Pools: one gateway, several fleet directories, one routing pool.

The data-gen gateway fronts the GLM fleet. Kimi-K3 joins it as a second
*pool*: its backends register into a fleet directory of their own, and a
fleet config of its own supervises them. Routing does not see pools at all --
every backend from every directory takes traffic exactly as the default
fleet's always has, whatever model a request names, and a conversation's pin
keeps it on one backend whichever pool that backend is in.

So the properties pinned here are, in this order: both pools' backends take
traffic; affinity and retries span pools; the status reports say which pool
each backend came from; each pool is supervised through its own fleet config,
or not at all; and a handover keeps every pool, refusing a successor that
would silently drop one.

Real `gateway.py` processes against fake backends, like the handover tests.
