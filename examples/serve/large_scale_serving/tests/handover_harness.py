"""Machinery for the gateway hot-handover tests. No assertions live here.

Everything in this file exists to make one sentence testable: *during a
handover a client with a steady stream of requests sees zero refused
connections and zero failed in-flight requests*. That sentence is only worth
anything if the thing under test is a real gateway process, so nothing here
mocks the gateway -- it starts `gateway.py` with `subprocess`, lets the real
handover spawn a real successor, and measures from outside with raw sockets.

Three pieces are worth reading before the tests:

`lease_port`
    Port choice is a correctness problem here, not a convenience one. The
    gateway binds with `SO_REUSEPORT` (work item E), and a `SO_REUSEPORT` bind
    *succeeds* against a port somebody else already holds the same way. So the
    usual "bind it, close it, assume it is free" check does not answer the
    question: a test could bind on top of a real gateway, have the kernel
    deal it half the connections, and measure a fleet that is not its own.
    Defence is in three layers -- an advisory `flock` per port so parallel test
    runs cannot choose the same one, a refused `connect()` so nothing is
    already listening, an exclusive (non-reuse) bind so nothing holds it
    without listening -- and then, because all three are checks-of-the-moment,
    a fourth that runs continuously: every `/_gateway/health` reply carries
    `deployment`, which is the basename of `--fleet-dir`, and the harness gives
    each run a unique one. A foreign gateway sharing the port is therefore not
    a silent wrong answer, it is an assertion failure naming the intruder.

`RequestStream`
    A client is only useful here if it can tell three failures apart:
    *refused* (the connection never came up -- the handover left the port
    unbound), *lost in flight* (the connection came up and then died with no
    usable reply -- the old process was killed instead of drained), and
    *served, badly* (an HTTP error, e.g. the 503 a successor serves in the
    window after it binds but before its first health probe). `http.client`
    collapses the first two. So the stream speaks HTTP over a raw socket and
    records which syscall failed.

`require_cli` / `require_endpoint`
    Work items A-E are not merged yet, so these tests are expected to fail.
    They should fail saying *which clause of the contract is missing*, not with
    an argparse traceback or a 404 from deep inside a wait loop.

    has been up for a few seconds before the handover. That is the only
    generation signal the contract's surface offers; see the report.
