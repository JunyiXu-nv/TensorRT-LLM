"""Stable front door for the Anthropic-compatibility server.

A serving job lives for hours and lands on whatever node the scheduler gives
it, so its URL changes every time it is rescheduled. Agent CLIs need one
address that never changes. This gateway holds that address and forwards to
whichever backend is currently healthy, so `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is written once
and never edited again.

    python3 gateway.py --fleet-dir /shared/fleet --users gateway_users.txt --no-relay

Backends announce themselves by dropping one JSON file per job into
`--fleet-dir` (see `discover` for the fields). Nothing else couples the gateway
to the jobs: it never talks to the launcher on the request path, so an
unhealthy or missing registry only costs routing, never correctness.

Relay mode (`--yaml` without `--no-relay`) additionally submits the successor
job before the current one hits its wall clock and reclaims the predecessor
once the successor has proven itself. That half drives the serving jobs through
a launcher script exposing `submit`, `restart` and `quit` subcommands, passed
with `--serve-sh`. That script is not part of this example yet, so relay mode
refuses to start without one rather than failing at the first handover.

Standard library only, on purpose: the gateway has to outlive every serving
job, so it runs outside the TRT-LLM container on whatever long-lived host is
available. Requiring httpx or uvicorn there would mean a venv, which means
outbound network -- one more thing that host has to provide.

Reading the access log
----------------------
Every line carries `rid=rNNNNNN`; grepping one id gives that request end to
end, which is the only way to read the log at all once requests overlap. The
status field is the backend's own status plus at most two suffixes:

    200     relayed intact
    200!    the stream had no terminal event, so the gateway appended one
    200?    the ending could not be delivered; the client had already gone
    502     the BACKEND failed -- it never answered, or answered unusably

The distinction between `200?` and `502` is the point. Both used to be logged
as 502, so a client that hung up mid-stream was indistinguishable from a
serving job that had fallen over, and the counts blamed the backend for both.
`side=` on each warning names which end of the proxy actually broke.

    than trusted away: anything that raises, returns a job that is not on
    offer, or takes the process down a path the built-ins would not is counted
    against the policy, and after `strikes` it is dropped and placement falls

    The eight steps of the design contract, with the ordering property that
    makes the whole thing tractable stated once, here: **this process does not
    close its listener until step 6**, which is after the successor has proved
    itself on the port. Every failure before that point is therefore a no-op
    for traffic -- the successor is killed and this process carries on with a
    listener it never stopped using, so there is nothing to reopen and no
    window in which nobody is accepting. Nothing below may move the close()
    earlier, and nothing before it may become irreversible.

    Steps 2, 7 and 8 are not implemented here. The pin-table flush belongs to
    the router, the supervisor lock to the supervisor and the drain to the
    request path; this class calls them and owns the order they happen in.
    They are resolved by name at call time rather than assumed, so this
    sequence can land and be exercised before they do: a missing collaborator
    degrades one step and says so, instead of turning the whole handover into
    an AttributeError halfway through.

    One trap, because it is invisible and it is fatal. asyncio's subprocess
    transport kills the child it is holding when the transport closes, and the
    transport closes on any orderly interpreter shutdown -- so from step 6,
    when the successor is the only listener left, this process exiting
    *politely* takes the gateway down with it. `_run` leaves through os._exit
    for that reason and swallows a cancel during the drain for the same one.
    Anything else added here that can end this process between step 6 and the

    busy to answer a health check, and a server that busy is normally still
    generating tokens fine; taking it out of rotation would turn "slow" into
    "503" with nowhere better to send the traffic.

    The path is `/v1/models` rather than `/health`, and the difference is not

    GPU nodes a container registry listens on one of the ports a fleet might

    request. The gateway elected it, called it healthy for half an hour, and
    404ed the traffic it sent there -- while the actual worker had died on
    "Address already in use" and nothing said so.

    `/v1/models` cannot be answered by accident. It is 404 until the OpenAI
    routes are mounted, which happens only once the deployment is genuinely

class SupervisorLock:
    """The exclusive right to take lifecycle actions on the fleet.

    A handover runs two gateways at once and both of them run `supervisor_loop`.
    Nothing that loop does is idempotent: two supervisors would each submit an
    eight-node successor for the same dead instance, or both drop a `restart`
    control file into one run dir and race the controller reading it. So
    `supervise` happens only while this is held. Discovery, probing and routing
    are read-only and deliberately keep running in both processes -- the
    successor has to already have a current fleet view at the moment it is asked
    to take traffic, not start building one then.

    `fcntl.flock`, and deliberately **not** a lease with a TTL or a heartbeat.
    The point of a kernel lock is that the kernel is what releases it: a gateway
    that segfaults, is SIGKILLed, or is torn down with its job drops this the
    instant its last fd closes -- no cleanup path that has to have run, no clock
    that has to be right, no operator deciding whether a record is stale. A TTL
    reintroduces the exact production failure this fleet has already paid for
    once, a state file insisting a controller was alive after it was gone, and
    adds a window where the lease has expired but its holder has not noticed,
    which is precisely the window in which two supervisors act at the same time.
    Handover is same-node by construction, so this never has to mean anything
    across hosts and nothing here leans on the shared filesystem's lock manager.

    The file's *contents* are diagnostics and nothing more: who holds it, where,
    since when -- so a handover that never completes can be read out of a log
    instead of guessed at. They are only ever reported after flock has already
    proved that somebody holds it, and nothing decides anything from them.
    Reading a pid out of this file and acting on it is the same trap as the TTL.

async def drain(server, deadline):
    """Stop accepting, let the requests already in flight finish, count the losses.

    Returns the number of requests abandoned -- zero unless the deadline ran
    out. The figure comes from `INFLIGHT` rather than from the server, because
    once the deadline has expired the server will no longer say how many
    handlers it is still holding.

    Waiting on BOTH the server and `INFLIGHT` is not belt and braces; neither
    one is sufficient, and the reason was measured on the 3.12.3 interpreter
    this runs against rather than taken from the docs.

    `close()` behaves as advertised: it returns immediately and the listening
    socket starts refusing at once (ECONNREFUSED, not a hang), while
    `wait_closed()` blocks for every connection still attached -- all of them,
    not just the first to finish.

    But "attached" is the catch. `wait_closed()` is keyed on the server's
    active *transport* count, which drops the moment the client's socket dies,
    not when the handler finishes. That distinction is invisible in a normal
    HTTP server, where the handler finishes by answering the client. It is not
    invisible in a proxy: when an agent CLI is killed mid-stream, this gateway
    is still holding the backend connection, still reading from it, and still
    has a request to finish or abandon -- and `wait_closed()` has already
    returned. Measured: with six streams whose clients had been RST, it
    returned in 0.02s with all six handlers still running. Draining on that
    alone would call the process idle and exit while it was demonstrably not.

    So `INFLIGHT.wait_idle()` covers the work, and `wait_closed()` covers the
    two edges the counter cannot see: a connection accepted whose handler task
    has not started yet, and the transport teardown after the handler returns.

    The deadline is not paranoia either. A connection that was accepted but
    whose client then went quiet holds the drain open exactly as firmly as one
    still streaming tokens -- `_handle` blocks in `read_head` for a request
    that never arrives. Unbounded, one such client keeps the outgoing gateway
