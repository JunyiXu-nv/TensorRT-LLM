# analysis

Per-request and engine-side metrics for one serving run, from what an attempt directory holds:
`request_trace/` (client-facing requests and responses), `perf_metrics/` (proxy and worker timing),
`adp_route_trace*.jsonl` (routing decisions) and the worker logs with the iteration lines:
`ctx-N.log` / `gen-N.log` on a disaggregated run, `server.log` on an aggregated one.

```
python3 analysis/report.py <attempt_dir>                        # whole run
python3 analysis/report.py <attempt_dir>/request_trace/<hour>   # one UTC hour
```

Writes `requests.csv`, `ctx_iters.csv`, `ctx_rank_iters.csv`, `gen_iters.csv`, `gen_rank_iters.csv`
and `REPORT.html` under `_reports/<run>[_<hour>]/`. The page opens with §0 · Metrics (below), then §1 requests, then the engine sections. On an aggregated run the four engine CSVs are
replaced by `worker_iters.csv` / `worker_rank_iters.csv` and the page has one engine section,
"Worker (prefill + decode)", instead of the ctx and gen sections.

Everything joins on the server's request id: `disagg_request_id` (the proxy's) on a disaggregated
run, `client_id` (the server's own `request_id`, unique per server process) on an aggregated one.
The mode is decided from the perf records (only a disaggregated run has proxy records), the engine
side from the log names.

| `requests_table.py` | one row per request: identity, usage tokens, latency phases, KV blocks, routing |
| `engine_iters.py` | iteration lines → per-rank rows and per-instance (ranks pooled) rows, pads removed |
| `charts.py` | SVG line charts and histograms, no dependencies |
| `report.py` | entry point; CSVs plus the HTML |
| `common.py` | time parsing, percentiles, CSV writer |

## REPORT.html §0 · Metrics

The headline numbers of the run as mean / p10 / p25 / p50 / p75 / p90 / p99 (mean, p10, p50 and p90 in red), over
completed requests only, in three blocks. Every input is a column of `requests.csv`; the formulas are the same in both
deployment modes and only the inputs differ (see the second table).

| block | row | formula | distribution over |
|---|---|---|---|
| E2E | E2E latency | `e2e_ms` | requests |
| E2E | Output tokens / E2E | `osl / e2e_s` | requests |
| E2E | Σ output tokens / Σ E2E | `Σ osl / Σ e2e_s` | 1-min buckets |
| E2E | (ISL new + OSL) / E2E | `(isl_new + osl) / e2e_s` | requests |
| E2E | Σ (ISL new + OSL) / Σ E2E | `Σ (isl_new + osl) / Σ e2e_s` | 1-min buckets |
| Throughput | Requests / s / GPU | `N / T / G` | 1-min buckets |
| Throughput | (ISL new + OSL) tokens / s / GPU | `Σ (isl_new + osl) / T / G` | 1-min buckets |
| Throughput | Output tokens / s / GPU | `Σ osl / T / G` | 1-min buckets |
| Throughput | Input tokens (ISL new) / s / GPU | `Σ isl_new / T / G` | 1-min buckets |
| Token-level SLO | TTFT | `ttft_ms` | requests |
| Token-level SLO | TPS / user | `(osl − 1) / (e2e_s − ttft_s)` = 1 / TPOT, requests with `osl ≥ 2` | requests |

Bucketed rows: a request belongs to the minute of its `finished_at`; the first and last partial minutes are dropped;
an empty minute is 0 in the Throughput block and skipped in the Σ / Σ rows (0 / 0). Their percentiles run over the
minutes, but their **mean cell is the whole-window value** — Σ over every completed request divided by Σ E2E, or by
the window length `T` (first start to last finish) × `G`. That is the request-second-weighted mean of the minutes,
not their plain average; under a fluctuating load the two differ (36 % on an overloaded hour), because a heavy
minute carries more request-seconds and a lower per-user speed. `Σ osl / Σ e2e` is also output throughput ÷ mean
concurrency (Little's law).

| input | disaggregated | aggregated |
|---|---|---|
| `e2e_ms` | trace `finished_at − started_at` | same |
| `ttft_ms` | proxy arrival → the ctx worker's first token, before the KV transfer; so `e2e − ttft` under TPS / user includes the transfer and the proxy hop | worker `server_arrival_time → first_token_time` |
| `osl`, `isl_total`, `isl_cached` | the usage block the client received | same |
| `isl_new` | `isl_total − isl_cached`; where a /v1/responses usage reports `cached == total` (the proxy bug fixed by 2026-09-16) the row falls back to `ctx_blocks_new × tokens_per_block` | same, no fallback: the one worker record's new blocks include the decode blocks |
| `G` | `Σ role: instances × tp × pp × cp` from `ctx_config.yaml`, `gen_config.yaml` and `disagg_config.yaml` (6P1D: 6 × 4 + 1 × 8 = 32); cross-checked against the distinct ranks per worker log | `tp × pp × cp` of `server_config.yaml` (8); ranks of `server.log` |

The GPU derivation and the cross-check are printed in the page notes; a mismatch between config and logs is flagged there.

**In the instance over time** (chart + table at the end of §0): four occupancy series sampled once a second.
*Client requests in the instance* counts conversations — turns grouped by `session`, the conversation_id the serve path
resolves for routing affinity — from the first turn's arrival to the last turn's end, so the tool-call gaps between
turns are included with no cap: the client is away but will come back for the same KV. *Turns in flight* counts
server-side requests (arrival → response end); *turns in prefill* runs from ctx first scheduled (`first token −
prefill_ms`) to the first token; *turns in decode* from the first token to the response end. Rejected and unanswered requests are excluded; a turn still open at the window's end is
cut there, and a conversation whose next turn falls in the next hour looks finished on an hourly report.

## REPORT.html §1 · Requests

**Latency** lists the phases of a request in the order they happen, indented by containment (an indented row lies
inside the span above it: TTFT and Decode inside E2E; proxy pre-dispatch, ctx overhead, prefill queue and prefill inside
TTFT; KV transfer and the gen decode inside Decode), with n / mean / p50 / p90 / p99 and each phase's **share of E2E** =
Σ phase / Σ E2E over the completed requests that have the phase (weighted by request length). **Tokens** is ISL total /
cached / new, OSL, cache hit ratio, KV transfer bytes (disaggregated) and the draft acceptance rate; the KV block counts
stay in `requests.csv`. The page uses Inter and JetBrains Mono from Google Fonts and falls back to the local sans-serif
stack offline. On an aggregated run **By rank (from the routing trace)** gives, per attention-DP rank, the request
count and the p50 of TTFT, engine queue and decode, each followed by its ratio to the lowest rank in brackets.

## REPORT.html §2 / §3 on a disaggregated run

Both engine sections open with a highlighted budget line (`max_num_tokens`, `max_batch_size`, `tokens_per_block`, workers ×
ranks, KV quotas of that worker type), then a scheduling table (ctx: iterations, pad share, average prefill requests and
ctx tokens per rank, budget utilization, busy ranks, rank skew, Σ paused, mean host / device step; gen: iterations,
idle-rank share, average decode requests and token slots per rank, tokens per request, batch occupancy, Σ paused, mean
host / device step) and a separate KV table (kv_cache_util, pool filled peak, cumulative hit rate, cross-tier totals).
The per-rank tables carry, per rank, Σ prefill requests / Σ real ctx tokens / share (ctx), average scheduled requests
and tokens over all of the rank's iterations (a pad or idle dummy counting 0), idle iterations, Σ paused, cumulative hit
rate (ctx), kv_cache_util (gen), pool filled, capacity blocks and the mean host / device step — every cell followed by its
ratio to the lowest rank in brackets.

## REPORT.html §2 on an aggregated run

The section opens with the budgets in a highlighted line (`max_num_tokens`, `max_batch_size`, `tokens_per_block`, rank
count, KV quotas), then a scheduling table (iterations, prefill / decode-only counts, idle-rank share, average prefill and
decode requests, ctx tokens and decode token slots per rank, budget utilization, batch occupancy, Σ paused, mean host
and device step) and a separate KV table (kv_cache_util, pool filled peak, cumulative hit rate, cross-tier totals). The
per-rank table lists Σ prefill requests, Σ real ctx tokens and their share, average scheduled requests and tokens
(prefill + decode, over all of the rank's iterations), idle iterations, Σ paused, cumulative hit rate, pool filled,
capacity blocks and the mean host / device step, every cell followed by its ratio to the lowest rank.

**Step times** (`tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/py_executor.py`, `profile_step`): `host_step_time` is `time.time()`
across the loop body that just finished, i.e. the wall clock of the iteration on the log line; Σ host step over an hour
equals the hour. `prev_device_step_time` is the elapsed time between two CUDA events recorded at the top of consecutive
loops on the GPU stream; the ping-pong event pair means the value printed on iteration N describes iteration N − 1, and
because the events bracket the whole loop it is the GPU-timeline span of the iteration, not GPU busy time (its sum also
equals the hour). `engine_iters.realign_device_step` shifts the device value back one iteration, so `device_step_ms`
on a row is the GPU-timeline span of that same iteration and the two columns are comparable row by row; a rank's last
row has no successor and keeps None.

## requests.csv

| column | definition |
|---|---|
| `rid` | join key to perf_metrics and the routing trace: `disagg_request_id`, or `client_id` when that is null (aggregated) |
| `session` | the conversation key the trace resolved for the request (headers, else `prompt_cache_key` / `client_metadata` in the body: the Codex thread id); `_no_session` when nothing was found |
| `started_at` | request arrival: middleware `server_arrival_time` (steady clock) plus the wall-clock offset recovered as `min(recorded_at − server_arrival_time)` over the attempt |
| `handler_entry_at` | the trace's `recorded_at`, stamped after the body was read and validated |
| `finished_at` | response `finished_at` |
| `parse_ms` | `handler_entry_at − started_at`: body read and validation before the handler ran (about 1.5 s per MB) |
| `server_overhead_ms` | worker `arrival_time − server_arrival_time`: HTTP handler to engine enqueue (the ctx worker's in a disaggregated run) |
| `proxy_dispatch_ms` | proxy `disagg_ctx_dispatch_time − disagg_server_arrival_time` (disaggregated only) |
| `status` | `rejected_400`, or the response status: `completed`, `error`, `client_disconnected`, `no_response`. In single-hour mode the next hour's response files are read as well (a request arriving at 09:59 ends in T10), so `no_response` means no response line in either hour; only the newest hour of a live instance still shows boundary spill as `no_response` |
| `isl_total`, `isl_cached`, `osl` | usage the client received (chat: last chunk; responses: `response.completed`) |
| `isl_new` | `isl_total − isl_cached` |
| `cache_hit_ratio` | `isl_cached / isl_total` |
| `ttft_ms` | proxy `disagg_server_first_token_time − disagg_server_arrival_time`; aggregated: worker `first_token_time − server_arrival_time` (not `server_first_token_time`, which that server stamps at response end) |
| `e2e_ms` | `finished_at − started_at` of the same trace_id |
| `decode_ms` | `e2e_ms − ttft_ms` |
| `prefill_queue_ms` | worker `first_scheduled_time − arrival_time` (ctx worker / the aggregated worker: "engine queue") |
| `prefill_ms` | worker `first_token_time − first_scheduled_time` (several chunked iterations on a cold long prompt) |
| `gpu_prefill_ms` | ctx worker `time_breakdown_metrics.ctx_gpu_forward_time` (disaggregated only) |
| `kv_transfer_ms`, `kv_transfer_bytes` | gen worker `kv_cache_transfer_end − start`, `kv_cache_size` (disaggregated only) |
| `gen_decode_ms` | `last_token_time − first_token_time` on the gen worker record, or on the one worker record when aggregated |
| `mtp_acceptance` | `speculative_decoding.acceptance_rate` of the decode-side record: accepted / proposed draft tokens over the request |
| `ctx_blocks_total/new/reused`, `gen_blocks_total` | worker `kv_cache_metrics` (aggregated: the one record fills both) |
| `ctx_instance`, `routed_rank`, `route_phase`, `route_iter`, `route_log_iter` | routing decision (`best_rank`, `phase`, batch iteration); aggregated: `ctx_instance` is `server` and the rank is where prefill and decode ran |

Caveat: on `/v1/responses` the server currently reports `cached_tokens == input_tokens`; the value is
recorded as received. `ctx_blocks_reused × tokens_per_block` is the engine-side measurement.

## ctx_rank_iters.csv / gen_rank_iters.csv / worker_rank_iters.csv (one row per worker, iteration, rank)

| column | definition |
|---|---|
| `engine_instance` | engine lifetime inside the log (the KV-sizing dry run is 0, the real engine 1) |
| `ctx_requests`, `ctx_tokens` | `states.num_ctx_requests` / `states.num_ctx_tokens` as logged: the rank's prefill work this iteration |
| `gen_tokens` | `states.num_generation_tokens`: decode token **slots**, requests × (draft length + 1) rounded up to the CUDA-graph batch size and, in a pure-decode attention-DP iteration, aligned across ranks. Not the tokens accepted; that is `mtp_acceptance` in requests.csv |
| `is_adp_pad` | idle-rank dummy. ctx: all four `kv_*_blocks` counters unchanged since this rank's previous iteration and `ctx_tokens ≥ 0.9 × max_num_tokens`. gen: one scheduled request with `kv_cache_util == 0`. aggregated worker: the gen rule, and no context request or tokens on the rank (it never gets a near-budget context pad) |
| `ctx_tokens_real` | `ctx_tokens`, or 0 for a pad |
| `decode_requests_real` | gen: `scheduled_requests`; aggregated: `scheduled_requests − ctx_requests`; 0 on an idle rank |
| `gen_tokens_real` | `gen_tokens`, or 0 on an idle rank |
| `total_tokens_real`, `total_budget_util` | `ctx_tokens_real + gen_tokens_real`, what the scheduler charged against `max_num_tokens` this iteration, and that share (aggregated worker only) |
| `token_budget_util` | `ctx_tokens_real / max_num_tokens` |
| `paused_requests` | `num_paused_requests`: admitted requests the scheduler set aside this iteration for lack of KV blocks or budget |
| `kv_hit_rate_iter` | `Δkv_reused_blocks / (Δreused + Δmissed)` for this iteration |
| `kv_hit_rate_cum` | the log's `kv_hit_rate`: the same ratio over the engine lifetime |
| `kv_cache_util` | as logged: share of blocks pinned by in-flight requests (`1 − available / max`) |
| `kv_capacity_blocks` | `max(kv_free_blocks + kv_evictable_blocks)` over the engine lifetime |
| `kv_pool_filled_ratio` | `1 − kv_free_blocks / kv_capacity_blocks`: blocks holding content, pinned or reusable |
| `kv_{offload,onboard,host_dropped}_blocks_delta/_total` | cross-tier movement this iteration (the log prints these drained per iteration, not cumulative) / running total since engine start. Unit is pages = pool-group slots, the same unit as `kv_free_blocks`; one page is one KV block of `tokens_per_block` tokens across all layers of the pool group |
| `host_step_ms`, `device_step_ms` | `host_step_time` (wall clock of this iteration); `prev_device_step_time` **of the next line of the same rank**, i.e. the GPU-timeline span of this iteration — the log prints it one iteration late and the table shifts it back; None on a rank's last row (see §2 notes) |

## ctx_iters.csv / gen_iters.csv / worker_iters.csv (ranks pooled per iteration)

| column | definition |
|---|---|
| `busy_ranks`, `has_prefill` | ranks with `ctx_tokens_real > 0`; any |
| `ctx_requests_sum` | Σ `ctx_requests` (prefill requests scheduled this iteration) |
| `ctx_tokens_mean` | mean of `ctx_tokens_real` over all ranks, pads included as 0 |
| `token_budget_util` | `ctx_tokens_mean / max_num_tokens` |
| `*_rank_skew` | `(max − mean) / mean` across ranks; 0 = even, `ranks − 1` = one rank has everything |
| `idle_ranks` | ranks flagged as pads this iteration |
| `decode_requests_sum`, `has_decode` | Σ `decode_requests_real`; any (gen) |
| `batch_occupancy` | mean `decode_requests_real` / `max_batch_size` (gen) |
| `tokens_per_request` | `Σ gen_tokens_real / Σ decode_requests_real` (gen): token slots per request, draft length + 1 under MTP plus whatever CUDA-graph padding shows |
| `decode_only` | `has_decode and not has_prefill` (aggregated worker) |
| `total_tokens_mean`, `total_budget_util` | mean of `total_tokens_real` over ranks; `/ max_num_tokens` (aggregated worker) |
| `kv_hit_rate_iter` / `kv_hit_rate_cum` | counters summed over ranks first, then divided |
| `kv_pool_filled_mean` | mean of the per-rank ratio |

## Aggregated deployments

One server (`server.log`, `server_config.yaml`, `adp_route_trace.jsonl`) runs prefill and decode on
the same ranks, so there is neither a proxy nor a KV transfer, and every request has exactly one
worker perf record. What changes:

- **Join.** `rid = client_id` (the response line's `disagg_request_id` is null); it equals the worker
  record's `request_id` and the routing decision's `client_id` (not its `req_id`, which is the engine's
  small sequential counter there). Verified 100 % on the traces this was built on.
- **Latency.** TTFT = worker `server_arrival_time → first_token_time`; server overhead = `→ arrival_time`;
  engine queue = `arrival_time → first_scheduled_time`; prefill = `→ first_token_time`; decode =
  `first_token_time → last_token_time`; E2E from the trace as before. Draft acceptance from the same record.
- **Report §1** shows the aggregated phase tree (no proxy dispatch, KV transfer or GPU-prefill rows; the body parse
  sits inside the server overhead) and "By rank (from the routing trace)" instead of "By context instance".
- **Report §2 "Worker (prefill + decode)"** replaces the ctx and gen sections: per worker, iterations with a
  prefill chunk vs decode-only, average prefill and decode requests per rank, ctx tokens and decode token
  slots per rank, budget utilization (ctx + decode) against `max_num_tokens`, batch occupancy against
  `max_batch_size`, paused requests, kv_cache_util, pool fill, hit rates, cross-tier totals, and step time
  split by whether the iteration carried a prefill chunk (a chunk on any rank stretches the step for all).
  Per-rank charts: decode requests, ctx tokens, decode token slots, ctx + decode tokens with the
  `max_num_tokens` line, budget utilization, paused, kv_cache_util, pool filled, cumulative hit rate, device
  step by iteration kind, and the three cross-tier charts.
- **Idle ranks** are the generation-style dummy (one scheduled request, `kv_cache_util` 0); there are no
  near-budget context pads on this worker. `rollup.json` carries `engine.mode` and an `engine.mixed` side.
