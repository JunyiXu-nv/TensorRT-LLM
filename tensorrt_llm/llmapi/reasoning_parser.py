    Same `<think>` / `</think>` delimiters as DeepSeek-R1, and the same
    prefilled opening tag, with one difference that shows up under agent
    workloads: GLM closes the block more than once. A turn ends its reasoning,
    writes another stretch of planning, and closes again before its tool call:

        ...recovered.</think>Let me retry exec after waiting.</think><tool_call>

    Treating everything after the first close as content -- correct for
    DeepSeek-R1 -- publishes those later tags as visible text. Here a close
    standing directly before a `<tool_call>` is a delimiter with nothing to
    delimit, so it is dropped rather than shown. Only that shape: a
    `</think>` elsewhere in visible text is the model quoting the marker --
    tool output, source code -- and stripping those corrupted the very
    arguments they sat in, so they are preserved verbatim.

    Only the redundant closing tag is affected. Where the split falls is
    unchanged, and models that never emit one keep the inherited behaviour,
    which is why this is a separate parser rather than an edit to the shared
    one.

    The same workloads also produce the opposite shape: GLM sometimes reaches
    a tool call having emitted no closing tag at all. Seen live on 2026-09-18
    (instance 477479, `disagg_request_id=10897237976417924`): 26,055
    characters over 169 frames with zero `<think>` and zero `</think>`, and
    one well-formed `<tool_call>` at offset 25,392. Because the template
    prefills `<think>`, the parser is still inside the block when that marker
    arrives, so the whole call -- markup included -- was published as
    reasoning text and the tool parser, which only sees content, never got a
    call to parse. So a `<tool_call>` seen inside the block ends it
    implicitly, the same way `<|tool_calls_section_begin|>` does for Kimi-K2
    and `<tool_call>` does for Nemotron (NVBug 6082303).

    And a third shape, seen live: the model closes the block, writes visible
    text, then emits `<think>` again mid-message. The first close wins -- the
    whole-text parse partitions on the first `</think>` and reads everything
    after it as content, later markers included, so the streamed parse must
    too. The base class instead re-enters reasoning on a `<think>` seen while
    outside the block, and silently drops the text standing before the marker
    in the same delta; on the recorded frames that lost 30 visible characters
    from the stream and classified the 384-character second block as
    reasoning, while the final snapshot kept both as content. Once the block
    is over, no delta re-enters it here.

        <|channel>thought
        REASONING_CONTENT<channel|>VISIBLE_CONTENT

    When the chat template is rendered with ``enable_thinking=False``, the
    server prefills ``<|channel>thought\n<channel|>`` so the model emits
    content directly without a reasoning block. When ``enable_thinking=True``,
    the model decides when to open/close the channel and may emit multiple
    channel blocks interleaved with content.

    Because ``<|channel>`` / ``<channel|>`` are registered special tokens in
    the Gemma 4 tokenizer, callers must set ``skip_special_tokens=False`` (or
    use a tool parser with ``needs_raw_special_tokens=True``) to ensure the
    delimiters appear in the decoded text stream.

    """Reasoning parser for Kimi-K2 and Kimi-K2.5 models.

    Extends DeepSeekR1Parser to support interleaved thinking where reasoning
    content may be implicitly ended by a tool call section. The model uses
    ``<think>...</think>`` tokens and may also start tool calls via
    ``<|tool_calls_section_begin|>`` without an explicit ``</think>`` tag.

    Supported patterns:

    * ``<think>reasoning</think>content`` – standard thinking
    * ``<think>reasoning<|tool_calls_section_begin|>...`` – interleaved
      thinking (reasoning interrupted by tool call)
    * ``content`` (no ``<think>``) – no reasoning

    For Kimi-K2.5, the chat template defaults to thinking mode (appends
    ``<think>`` to prompt). When ``thinking=False`` is passed via
    ``chat_template_kwargs``, the template appends ``<think></think>``
    instead, and the model output has no thinking tags — this parser
    dynamically adjusts ``reasoning_at_start`` accordingly.

    K3 renders assistant messages as an XTML tag stream built from the
    special tokens ``<|open|>`` / ``<|close|>`` / ``<|sep|>`` /
    ``<|end_of_msg|>`` with plain-text tag headers (see the checkpoint's
    ``encoding_k3.py``)::

        <|open|>think<|sep|>REASONING<|close|>think<|sep|>
        <|open|>response<|sep|>CONTENT<|close|>response<|sep|>
        [<|open|>tools<|sep|>...calls...<|close|>tools<|sep|>]
        <|close|>message<|sep|><|end_of_msg|>

    The generation prompt already ends inside ``<|open|>think<|sep|>``
    (thinking mode, the default) or ``<|open|>response<|sep|>``
    (``chat_template_kwargs={"thinking": False}``), so the model output
    begins mid-channel with no opening tag.

    Every generated byte lands in exactly one place:

    * the think channel is ``reasoning_content``, the response channel is
      ``content``;
    * text outside any channel - after ``<|close|>think<|sep|>`` with no
      ``<|open|>response<|sep|>``, after a tools section - is ``content``.
      A gap of pure whitespace between two structural tags is formatting
      and is consumed with them;
    * a tools section holding at least one well-formed call goes to
      ``content`` verbatim for the ``kimi_k3`` tool parser, except the
      ``think`` blocks between its calls, whose bodies are
      ``reasoning_content``. A "section" without a single well-formed call
      is the model writing about the format and stays, verbatim, in the
      channel it appeared in;
    * a tag is structural only where the grammar allows it: opening a
      channel other than the current one, closing the current one, or the
      ``<|close|>message<|sep|>`` / ``<|end_of_msg|>`` framing that ends the
      generation. Anywhere else it is literal text of the current channel.

    ``parse`` runs the state machine behind ``parse_delta`` + ``finish``
    over the whole text, so the one-shot reading equals the streamed one
    for every chunking.

    The grammar of a tools section (``scan_tools_section`` and its helpers)
    lives here and is shared with ``KimiK3ToolParser``, so the two parsers
    cannot disagree about where a section, a call or a value ends.

    Limitation: the parsers see decoded text only. Marker text the model
    spelled out of ordinary tokens decodes to the same string as the marker
    tokens (ids 163586-163589), so markup that is valid where it appears is
    read as structure - a complete call quoted inside reasoning is
    delivered as a call, a value that literally contains
    ``<|close|>argument<|sep|>`` followed by more structure is cut there,
    and an ``<|open|>response<|sep|>`` written inside the think channel
    switches channels. Such text is never dropped, but it can be routed to
    the wrong place.
