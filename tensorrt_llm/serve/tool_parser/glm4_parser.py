    The markup has no escaping, so a value that *contains* the closing tag -
    a shell or JS payload quoting it, say - is indistinguishable from the tag
    itself at the moment it appears. Cutting the value at the first match is
    what used to truncate such payloads. The tag is therefore only honored
    when what follows it is consistent with the enclosing structure: the next
    ``<arg_key>`` or the end of the call. Returns one of

    * ``"key"``     - separators then a complete ``<arg_key>``: a real close.
    * ``"pending"`` - the buffer could still become a real close: separators,
      a prefix of ``<arg_key>`` or of ``</tool_call>``, or a lone ``\\`` that
      may yet become a literal ``\\n`` separator.
    * ``"content"`` - anything else: the tag was part of the value.

    ``</tool_call>`` never reaches this buffer whole - the surrounding
    regexes cut the argument text at it - only as a partial tail, which stays
    pending until the caller finalizes the call and flushes.

    The residual ambiguity is honest: a value that itself contains a
    well-formed ``</arg_value><arg_key>`` (or ``</arg_value></tool_call>``)
    sequence reads as structure and truncates there. Nothing in the grammar
    can distinguish it; both parse paths read it the same way, which is the

    it still prefixes the closing tag, so it arrives here as a dead prefix
    plus the character that killed it - and since ``<`` appears nowhere in
    the tag past position 0, the only place a fresh match can begin is a
    trailing ``<``. Releasing the whole buffer instead, as this used to,
    swallowed that ``<`` as value content when it was really the tag's
    opener: a value ending in ``<`` (C++ template syntax, in a recorded grep
    pattern) put ``<<`` in the buffer, both characters went out as value,
    and the real ``</arg_value>`` behind them could never match from its
    first byte again - the close went unseen and the withheld value reached

    the name and delivered verbatim: two recorded GLM-5.3 calls reached their

    doubling the opener) and ``exec<arg_value>input</arg_key>...`` (tags
    written out of order), and the client, seeing an unknown tool, lost the
    turn. Returns one of

    * ``("clean", name)`` - no junk. The well-formed path, unchanged.
    * ``("restart", offset)`` - `junk` holds a fresh ``<tool_call>`` (the last
      one, at `offset` within `junk`): the model abandoned the call it had
      opened and started over. Everything before the fresh opener is dead
      markup - its own name region is already junk-terminated, so no later
      text can make it parse - and the call that follows is the one the model
      meant. Callers release the dead prefix as ordinary text and parse on
      from the fresh opener.
    * ``("repaired", resolved)`` - the resolver strips the junk back to a
      declared tool (``apply_patch</arg_value>`` -> ``apply_patch``): the
      established recovery for an unbalanced tag fused onto a real name,
      preserved exactly because the arguments that follow are intact.
    * ``("malformed", None)`` - junk that maps onto nothing declared. The call
      must not be delivered: a name carrying markup is what the client just
      rejects wholesale, and inventing a call under a guessed name is worse.
      Callers release the call's entire text as ordinary output - the same
      stance `_flush_tool_parser` takes for unterminated markup, because
      silently losing model output is worse than showing a call that never
      parsed.

    Streaming callers may act on ``"restart"`` the moment it appears - a
    complete ``<tool_call>`` inside the junk is fixed text and final - but
    must gate the other verdicts on the structural token that seals the
