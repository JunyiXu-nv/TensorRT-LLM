# Supported HTTP header protocol for external clients, gateways, or proxies
# that carry a stable multi-turn identifier outside the JSON body. Body
# ``conversation_params.conversation_id`` is canonical when both body and
# headers are set; the serve edge copies the first non-empty header value into
# ``request.conversation_params`` only when the body omits it. Routers then read
# ``conversation_params.conversation_id`` to keep later turns of the same
# conversation on the same backend when sticky conversation routing is enabled.
#
# The Claude Code headers are listed first because a client that sends one also
# sends nothing else on this list; ordering them ahead of the generic names
# keeps the common case a single lookup. They mirror the set the Anthropic
# adapter already reads for audit records, so the Messages API gets the same
# conversation identity the audit log records rather than a second notion of a
# session.

# Body fields that carry a stable conversation identity for clients that speak
# no header protocol at all. Consulted only after the body's own
# ``conversation_params`` and the headers above have come up empty, so a gateway
# that sets a header still wins. Each entry is a path into the request body.
#
# Codex CLI is the client that motivated the list. Over the Responses API it
# sets ``prompt_cache_key`` -- OpenAI's cache-affinity hint -- to its thread id;
# over chat completions the same id sits in ``client_metadata.thread_id``. A
# thread is one conversation and stays constant across context compaction and
# resumed sessions, which is exactly what sticky routing needs.
# ``client_metadata.session_id`` is one Codex *run*, which can hold several
# threads (multi-agent), so it is only the last resort: in a single-conversation
# run it equals thread_id and the result is the same.
