"""Dump what the model actually produced, before any endpoint formatter sees it.

Enabled by pointing ``TRTLLM_RAW_OUTPUT_DIR`` at a directory and passing
``--post_processor_hook tensorrt_llm.executor.raw_output_hook.RawOutputDump``;
with either half missing the whole thing is inert. One JSONL file per UTC hour::

    $TRTLLM_RAW_OUTPUT_DIR/
      2026-09-18T07/
        raw-<pid>.jsonl    one line per (request, output), when it finishes

What this records exists nowhere else. ``request_trace.py`` keeps the wire
payload, which is what the reasoning and tool parsers made of the text; when a
parser drops a tool call or raises "Incomplete DSML invoke", the text it was
looking at is already gone. This runs at the detok chokepoint -- after
``text``/``text_diff`` are populated and before any per-endpoint formatter reads
them -- so the two together show the transformation from both ends.

Reading it beside a trace
-------------------------
The join is the engine request id. It reaches the client as the response id
(``postprocess_handlers.py`` mints ``chatcmpl-<id>`` / ``cmpl-<id>``), so it is
inside the body ``request_trace`` records, and it is ``chunk.request_id`` here.

That holds through disaggregation, which is the case that needs it: the parsers
run only in the generation worker (``--tool_parser`` is generation-only) while
the request trace deliberately skips internal orchestrator hops, so the
generation worker writes no trace line at all and has no ``trace_id`` to stamp.
What makes the join survive anyway is that the proxy is a byte relay -- it
forwards the worker's frames without reassembling them -- so the id the client
sees, and the proxy records, is the one the generation worker minted.

Why the frames are kept apart
-----------------------------
A streaming record holds the deltas as a list rather than one joined string.
Incremental parsers are the thing being debugged and they fail *on the seams*:
a tool-call marker split across two chunks, a reasoning tag closed in the chunk
after it opened. Joining the deltas before writing destroys exactly the evidence
that distinguishes "the model never emitted it" from "the parser lost it at a
chunk boundary". ``text`` is stored too, so a reader wanting the whole output
does not have to join them.
